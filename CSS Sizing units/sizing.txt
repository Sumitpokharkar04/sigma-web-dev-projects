Yes, your understanding of vw and vh is exactly right. üëç

A width of 100vw will always cover the full viewport width, and a height of 100vh will always cover the full viewport height, no matter the device.

Where the Confusion About vmin Lies

You're on the right track, but there are two small, important corrections to your thinking about vmin.

A CSS property always applies if you write it. It never "won't apply anything". The vmin unit just calculates a value (a number) for that property.

Let's break down your examples:

ü§î Scenario 1: height: 100vmin;

You are correct about the laptop, but mistaken about the mobile phone. The height property will be applied on the phone.

    On your Laptop (e.g., 1200px wide, 800px tall):

        The browser sees the height (800px) is smaller.

        100vmin is calculated to be 800px.

        The final applied style is height: 800px;.

    On your Mobile Phone (e.g., 400px wide, 900px tall):

        The browser sees the width (400px) is now smaller.

        100vmin is calculated to be 400px.

        The final applied style is height: 400px;. It does not ignore the rule; it simply applies a different calculated value.

ü§î Scenario 2: width: 100vmin; height: 100vmin;

This is the most important point: both properties will apply. You will get a perfect square whose sides are equal to the smaller dimension of the viewport.

    On your Laptop (smaller dimension is 800px height):

        The style becomes width: 800px; height: 800px;.

    On your Mobile Phone (smaller dimension is 400px width):

        The style becomes width: 400px; height: 400px;.

This is the primary power of vmin: creating perfectly proportional elements that always fit on the screen, shrinking or growing with the browser window while maintaining their shape.

In summary: A CSS rule (height: 100vmin;) is an instruction that is always followed. The vmin part is just a flexible calculator that supplies the value for that instruction.
